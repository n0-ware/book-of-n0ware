# Vulnerability Results
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`

## Vulnerability Scan Reports

- **Summary Report**: Color-coded based on criticality, with red indicating high-severity vulnerabilities.
- **Review Options**: By scope (across all hosts) or by individual host.
- **Details**: Include links to vulnerability descriptions and remediation advice.

## False Positives

- **Definition**: Incorrect identification of a vulnerability by a scanner.
- **Impact**: Can lead to wasted time and resources on non-issues.
- **Risk**: High rates of false positives may result in disregarding important scan results.

## False Negatives

- **Definition**: Missed vulnerabilities that a scan fails to detect.
- **Mitigation**: Periodic scans and using scanners from multiple vendors to reduce risk.
- **Concern**: May lead to a false sense of security due to undetected threats.

## Log Review for Validation

- **Purpose**: To confirm the validity of vulnerability reports.
- **Process**: Examining system and network logs for evidence supporting or refuting scan findings.
- **Example**: Event logs confirming a reported process failure, validating the identified vulnerability.

## Best Practices

- **Active/Intrusive Scanning**: Reduces false positives by more accurately detecting vulnerabilities.
- **Vigilance Against False Negatives**: Regular and varied scanning practices to uncover missed vulnerabilities.
- **Utilizing Log Data**: Crucial for verifying scan results and ensuring identified vulnerabilities are accurate.

Understanding the balance between false positives, false negatives, and the importance of log review is essential in vulnerability management. This approach ensures that resources are efficiently allocated to address genuine threats while maintaining vigilance against potential undetected vulnerabilities.
