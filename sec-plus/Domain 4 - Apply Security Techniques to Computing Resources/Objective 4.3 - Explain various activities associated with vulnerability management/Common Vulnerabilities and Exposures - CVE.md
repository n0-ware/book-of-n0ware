# Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVE
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`
> *Last Modified:* `=this.file.mday`
## Overview

CVEs are documented in an effort to standardize the identification of known vulnerabilities in software, facilitating the sharing of data across different platforms and tools.

## Key Components

### Automated Scanners and Vulnerability Feeds

- Automated scanners rely on up-to-date vulnerability feeds to identify known vulnerabilities.
- Tools like Nessus and OpenVAS use "plug-ins" or "network vulnerability tests (NVTs)" as part of their scanning capabilities.
- The latest feed updates often require a subscription as part of scan vendors' commercial models.

### National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

- Maintained by NIST, provides detailed information on known software vulnerabilities.
- URL: [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov)
- Includes descriptions, severity ratings, affected software versions, and mitigation measures.

### Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)

- Used by many vulnerability scanners to update feeds or plug-ins.
- URL: [SCAP](https://scap.nist.gov)
- Facilitates comparison of system configurations to secure baselines and standardizes common identifiers.

### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

- A dictionary of publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures.
- URL: [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org)
- Entries include an identifier (CVE-YYYY-####), a description, reference URLs, and creation date.

### Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

- Maintained by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST).
- URL: [CVSS](https://first.org/cvss)
- Generates a score from 0 to 10 based on vulnerability characteristics, categorized into Low (0.1+), Medium (4.0+), High (7.0+), and Critical (9.0+).

## Importance

Vulnerability feeds, CVE, and CVSS scores play crucial roles in vulnerability management by providing standardized, actionable intelligence. This enables organizations to prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities effectively, enhancing their cybersecurity posture.
