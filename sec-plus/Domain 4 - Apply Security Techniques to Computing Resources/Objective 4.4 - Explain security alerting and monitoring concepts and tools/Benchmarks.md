# Benchmarks

Vulnerability scans assess the security controls, application settings, and permissions against established benchmarks to ensure configurations meet best practices and compliance requirements.

## Key Components

### Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)

- **Purpose**: Determines if a computer meets a specific configuration baseline.
- **Components**:
  - **Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)**: Describes the system's security state and queries vulnerability reports.
  - **Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF)**: Develops and audits configuration checklists and rules in a machine-readable format.

## Compliance Scanning

- **Objective**: Measures systems against best practice frameworks for regulatory compliance or adherence to standards.
- **Examples**:
  - Comparison of local network security policies against benchmarks.
  - Monitoring templates aligned with frameworks like NIST 800-53.

Compliance scanning is essential for identifying necessary security controls, detecting misconfigurations (e.g., outdated antivirus software, default passwords), and ensuring systems align with industry best practices and regulatory standards.
