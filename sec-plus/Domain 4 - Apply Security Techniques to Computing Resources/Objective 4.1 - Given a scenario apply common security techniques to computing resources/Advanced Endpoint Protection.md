# Advanced Endpoint Protection
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`
> *Last Modified:* `=this.file.mday`
## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
- **Objective**: Provides real-time and historical visibility into endpoint compromises, containing malware within hosts, and facilitating remediation.
- **Features**:
  - Managed from a cloud portal.
  - Utilizes AI and machine learning for behavior analysis.
- **Benefits**: Detects and responds to advanced threats, offering forensic insights post-breach.

## Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
- **Expansion**: Goes beyond EDR by integrating data from the network, cloud, email, firewall, and other infrastructures.
- **Advantages**: Offers a comprehensive security view, improving threat identification and response times.

## Host-Based Intrusion Detection/Prevention (HIDS/HIPS)
- **Functionality**: Monitors and protects individual hosts from unauthorized access and malicious activities.
- **Techniques**: Includes signature-based detection, anomaly detection, and behavior analysis.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: Audits key system files to ensure they match authorized versions, detecting unauthorized changes.
- **Examples**: Tripwire, OSSEC.

## User Behavior Analytics (UBA)/User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
- **Purpose**: Monitors user behaviors to detect anomalies signaling potential threats like insider threats or compromised accounts.
- **Methodology**: Utilizes machine learning and statistical analysis to establish baseline profiles and identify deviations.
- **Applications**: Alerts on unusual activities, such as abnormal data downloads or logins from unexpected locations.
- **Commercial Products**: Splunk User Behavior Analytics, IBM QRadar User Behavior Analytics, Rapid7 InsightIDR, Forcepoint Insider Threat.

Advanced endpoint protection technologies like EDR, XDR, HIDS/HIPS, and UBA/UEBA are essential in modern cybersecurity strategies. They provide deep visibility into endpoint activities, enhance threat detection and response capabilities, and help secure the organizational environment against a wide range of sophisticated threats.
