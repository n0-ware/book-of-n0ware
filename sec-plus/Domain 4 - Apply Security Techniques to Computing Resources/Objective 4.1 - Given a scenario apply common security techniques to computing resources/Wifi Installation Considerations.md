# WIRELESS NETWORK INSTALLATION CONSIDERATIONS

Effective wireless network installation is crucial for ensuring robust and secure Wi-Fi coverage. Key factors include WAP placement, understanding of the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, and conducting site surveys to generate heat maps for optimal configuration.

## Wireless Access Point (WAP) Placement
- **Network Structure**: An infrastructure-based wireless network relies on multiple WAPs connected to a wired network, facilitating traffic between wireless and wired segments.
- **Identification**: WAPs are identified by MAC addresses (BSSID), and wireless networks are named by SSIDs.
- **Frequency Bands**: Networks operate in 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands, each divided into channels. Channels should be spaced to minimize interference, with the 5 GHz band offering more non-overlapping channels.

## Site Surveys and Heat Maps
- **Purpose**: To map out signal strength and channel usage across the desired coverage area, identifying interference sources like walls and electronic devices.
- **Process**: Involves moving around the area with a Wi-Fi-enabled device equipped with analyzer software, marking down signal strength at various points.
- **Output**: The collected data is used to create a heat map, visually representing areas with strong (green/blue) or weak (red) signals and overlapping channels.

## Key Tools and Outputs
- **Wi-Fi Analyzer Tools**: Software like Lizard System's Wi-Fi Scanner collects signal strength, network names, MAC addresses, and other pertinent Wi-Fi data.
- **Heat Maps**: Visual representations showing signal coverage across an area, with color coding to indicate signal strength levels. Heat maps assist in making informed decisions on adjusting WAP transmit power, changing channels, or relocating WAPs for optimal coverage.

## Example Scenarios
- **Wi-Fi Scanner Output**: Provides a snapshot of the Wi-Fi environment, including signal strength, quality, and network details.
- **Predictive Test Heat Map**: Offers a detailed view of signal distribution in an office space, highlighting areas of strong to no signal strength, aiding in strategic WAP placement.

Effective wireless network setup requires careful planning and consideration of physical and electronic interference factors. By conducting thorough site surveys and analyzing heat maps, organizations can achieve comprehensive Wi-Fi coverage, minimizing the risk of rogue and evil twin attacks due to patchy network coverage.
