# Endpoint Configuration
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`
> *Last Modified:* `=this.file.mday`

Endpoint security breaches require careful consideration across several vectors for effective mitigation. Here's an overview:

## Social Engineering
- **Strategy**: Use security education and awareness to reduce future attack success.
- **Implementation**: Review and potentially lower account privilege levels.

## Vulnerabilities
- **Approach**: Install patches or isolate systems until a patch is developed.

## Lack of Security Controls
- **Solution**: Investigate deploying endpoint protection, firewalls, DLP, or MDM. Isolate the system if deployment isn't practical.

## Configuration Drift
- **Method**: Reapply baseline configuration and investigate procedures to prevent ad hoc changes.

## Weak Configuration
- **Tactic**: Review and devise more secure settings for the template. Apply to similar hosts.

# Access Control

Access control is about managing permissions for users, systems, and networks. Key concepts include:

## Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)
- **Goal**: Grant minimum permissions necessary for duties.
- **Implementation**: Audit user roles and responsibilities. Use tools for user and account management. Regularly review and remove unnecessary accounts. Implement role-based access control (RBAC).

## Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- **Usage**: Enforce access control policies. Associated with routers, firewalls, or devices to filter network traffic based on set criteria.

## File System Permissions
- **Linux Example**: Use `chmod` for modifying permissions. Permissions applied in the context of owner, group, and others. Use octal notation for setting permissions.

# Endpoint Hardening

Hardening aims to enhance system security by minimizing vulnerabilities. Strategies include:

## Segmentation
- **Benefit**: Isolates systems to limit attack spread.

## Isolation
- **Purpose**: Segregates devices to prevent lateral threat spread.

## Antivirus and Antimalware
- **Evolution**: From signature-based detection to leveraging AI and machine learning.

## Disk Encryption
- **Types**: Full disk encryption (FDE) and self-encrypting drives (SEDs). Use TPM for secure key storage.

## Patch Management
- **Importance**: Apply missing patches promptly. Use automated vulnerability scanners and enterprise patch management suites for deployment.

# Advanced Endpoint Protection

Advanced strategies include EDR, XDR, HIDS/HIPS, and UBA/UEBA:

## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) & Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
- **EDR**: Real-time monitoring of endpoints. Utilizes AI for behavior analysis.
- **XDR**: Extends EDR capabilities across networks, cloud, and infrastructures for comprehensive protection.

## Host-Based Intrusion Detection/Prevention (HIDS/HIPS)
- **Function**: Monitors individual hosts for unauthorized access and malicious activities.

## User Behavior Analytics (UBA)/User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
- **Objective**: Detect anomalies in user behavior indicating potential threats.

Effective endpoint configuration and advanced protection strategies are essential for maintaining robust security postures, minimizing vulnerabilities, and ensuring the resilience of organizational IT environments.
