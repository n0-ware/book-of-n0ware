# Network Logs

Network data sources offer critical information for investigating security incidents and monitoring network behavior. These sources include network logs, firewall logs, and IPS/IDS logs.

## Network Logs

- **Source**: Generated by network appliances like routers, firewalls, switches, and access points.
- **Contents**: Record appliance operation, system logs, traffic, and access logs.
- **Significance**: Useful for identifying network threats and behaviors, such as on-path attacks, scanning activities, and disassociation events in wireless networks.

## Firewall Logs

- **Generation**: Firewall rules can be configured to generate events when triggered.
- **Log-Only Rules**: It is possible to configure log-only rules for testing or high-impact rules.
- **Contents**: Firewall audit events include date/timestamp, interface, traffic direction (incoming/egress), accept/drop status, source/destination addresses, and port numbers.
- **Significance**: Crucial for confirming whether connections were allowed or denied and identifying rule adjustments needed.

## IPS/IDS Logs

- **Generation**: IPS/IDS logs are generated when traffic patterns match predefined rules.
- **Volume Control**: Logging high sensitivity/impact rules is recommended to manage event volume.
- **Contents**: Events record matched rules and can include shuns, resets, and redirects.
- **Use in Dashboards**: Summary event data can be visualized in dashboard graphs to represent overall threat levels.
- **Significance**: Helps attribute intrusion events to specific actors and develop threat intelligence regarding tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

Network data sources are essential for monitoring network security, identifying threats, and enhancing incident response capabilities.
