# Multifactor Authentication
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`

Multifactor Authentication (MFA) strengthens security by requiring multiple forms of verification before granting access to a system or application. It moves beyond traditional password-based security, incorporating additional authentication factors to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.

## Authentication Factors

### Something You Have

- **Ownership Factor**: Involves items uniquely possessed by the user, like smart cards, key fobs, or smartphones that generate or receive cryptographic tokens.

### Something You Are

- **Biometric Factor**: Utilizes physiological or behavioral identifiers, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or gait, to authenticate users based on unique personal characteristics.

### Somewhere You Are

- **Location-Based Factor**: Authentication based on the user's geographic location or network address. While not a standalone factor, it can enhance security by verifying user location or restricting access based on anomalous login attempts from unexpected locations.

## Implementing MFA

- MFA is about combining different types of authentication factors to create a more secure verification process. It's not merely using multiple instances of the same type (e.g., two knowledge factors like a PIN and a date of birth).
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: A specific form of MFA that uses exactly two different factors, enhancing security without the complexity of additional verification steps.

## Benefits of MFA

- **Enhanced Security**: Significantly reduces the risk of compromised credentials leading to unauthorized access.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets security requirements specified in various data protection regulations.
- **Flexible Security Policies**: Allows organizations to apply tailored access controls based on user roles, locations, and other criteria.

## Considerations

- **User Convenience**: While MFA provides a higher security level, it must be balanced with user convenience to avoid resistance or bypassing security measures.
- **Deployment Strategy**: Organizations should consider the most suitable factor combinations for their specific security needs and user population.

MFA is a critical component of modern cybersecurity strategies, offering a balanced approach to security that protects against the vulnerabilities inherent in single-factor authentication systems.
