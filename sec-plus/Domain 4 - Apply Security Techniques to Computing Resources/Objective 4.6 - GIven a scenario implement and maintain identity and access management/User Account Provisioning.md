## Overview
- **Definition**: The process of setting up user accounts as per standard procedures or best practices.
- **Purpose**: To manage assets, including user accounts for employees, consultants, contractors, and customers.

## Provisioning Steps
1. **Identity Proofing**:
   - Verifies identity using official documents and records.
   - May include background checks for addresses, education, employment, criminal records, and credit issues.
2. **Issuing Credentials**:
   - Enables users to select passwords or enroll in biometric/token-based authentication methods.
3. **Issuing Hardware and Software Assets**:
   - Provides necessary computing devices and software applications.
   - Addresses the risk of shadow IT by ensuring resource adequacy.
4. **Teaching Policy Awareness**:
   - Schedules training and provides learning resources on security policies.
   - Informs about personal use policies for IT assets.
5. **Creating Permissions Assignment**:
   - Configures access rights based on work roles using RBAC, MAC, or ABAC models.
   - Tags accounts with privileged access for close monitoring.

## Deprovisioning Process
- **Purpose**: To remove access rights and permissions when an employee or contractor's engagement ends.
- **Steps**:
  - Removing the user from roles or security groups.
  - Disabling the account temporarily, then deleting, or deleting immediately.

## Best Practices
- **Accurate Identity Verification**: Ensures only authorized individuals are granted access.
- **Secure Credential Management**: Reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Resource Adequacy**: Prevents unauthorized acquisition of IT resources (shadow IT).
- **Security Policy Education**: Enhances awareness and compliance.
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Simplifies access management and enhances security.
- **Timely Deprovisioning**: Minimizes security risks from inactive accounts.
