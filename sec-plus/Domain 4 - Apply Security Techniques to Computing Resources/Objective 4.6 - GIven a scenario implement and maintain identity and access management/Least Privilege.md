# Least Privilege
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`
> *Last Modified:* `=this.file.mday`
## Definition
- **Least Privilege**: Ensuring a principal (user or service account) has the minimum rights necessary to perform authorized tasks, reducing risk if compromised.

## Implementation Challenges
- **Complexity**: Managing permissions across many users, groups, roles, and resources can be difficult.
- **Impacts of Misconfiguration**:
  - **Too Restrictive**: Leads to increased support calls and reduced productivity.
  - **Too Permissive**: Weakens security, raising the risk of malware infection and data breaches.

## Mitigating Risks
- **Design Phase**: Analyzing business workflows to determine required roles and permissions.
- **Continual Monitoring**: Necessary to prevent authorization creep, where users gradually gain unnecessary rights.
- **Temporary Privileges**: Systems must ensure elevated privileges are revoked after a set period.
- **Regular Auditing**:
  - Reviews privileges and monitors group memberships.
  - Checks access control lists for resources.
  - Identifies and disables unnecessary accounts.

## Example of Monitoring
- **Advanced Security Settings for LABFILES**: A tool for determining effective permissions for shared resources, helping in the management and auditing of access rights.

## Best Practices
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigns permissions based on roles to simplify management.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Utilizes attributes for dynamic permission assignment based on context.
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Ensures permissions align with current job functions and reduces excess privileges.
- **Automation Tools**: Aid in managing complex environments by automatically adjusting permissions and enforcing policies.
