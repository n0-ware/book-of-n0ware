# INCIDENT RESPONSE PROCESSES

A cybersecurity incident response follows a well-defined lifecycle with seven key phases:

## 1. Preparation

- Focus: Making systems resilient to attacks.
- Actions: Harden systems, establish policies and procedures, set up confidential communication channels, create incident response resources and procedures.

## 2. Detection

- Focus: Discovering indicators of threat actor activity.
- Sources: Automated intrusion systems, threat hunting operations, employee, customer, or law enforcement reports.

## 3. Analysis

- Focus: Determining if an incident has occurred and assessing severity.
- Actions: Triage and analyze data to confirm incident and severity.

## 4. Containment

- Focus: Limiting the scope and impact of the incident.
- Actions: Secure data, notify stakeholders, and identify reporting requirements.

## 5. Eradication

- Focus: Removing the root cause and restoring affected systems.
- Actions: Apply secure configurations, install patches, ensure a secure state.

## 6. Recovery

- Focus: Reintegrating systems into business processes.
- Actions: Restore data from backups, perform security testing, monitor systems closely to prevent reoccurrence.

## 7. Lessons Learned

- Focus: Analyzing the incident and responses for improvements.
- Actions: Document the incident, identify areas for improvement, and feed back into the preparation phase.

The incident response process may require coordination across various departments and managers, adding complexity. Major incidents that pose an existential threat to company-wide operations are handled by disaster recovery processes, but a cybersecurity incident can trigger a major incident declaration.

The key goal is to effectively respond to cybersecurity incidents, minimize their impact, and continually improve incident response procedures.
