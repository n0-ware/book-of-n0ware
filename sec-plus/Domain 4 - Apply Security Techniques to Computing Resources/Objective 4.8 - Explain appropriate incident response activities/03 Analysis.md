# Analysis

## Investigation and Prioritization

- The first responder investigates reported indicators to verify if a true incident has occurred.
- Classification as a true positive or false positive often relies on correlating multiple indicators.
- For complex or high-impact incidents, the analysis may be escalated to senior CIRT team members.

## Determining Impact

Several factors affect the determination of impact, including:
- Data integrity: The value of data at risk.
- Downtime: Disruption of business processes, including degradation or interruption of availability.
- Economic and publicity: Short-term and long-term economic effects, including reputation damage.
- Scope: The number of systems affected, not always a direct indicator of priority.
- Detection time: Time to detect the incident, which can vary significantly.
- Recovery time: Lengthy remediation for complex system changes.

## Incident Categories and Threat Intelligence

- Incident categories and definitions ensure a shared understanding within the response team.
- Threat intelligence provides insights into adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- The cyber kill chain framework is used to describe attack stages.

## Playbooks

- Playbooks are data-driven standard operating procedures (SOPs) for specific cyber threat scenarios.
- They guide analysts through analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned steps.
- Playbooks are developed based on typical incident profiles or scenarios.
