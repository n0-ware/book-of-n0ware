# Detection

## Indicators of an Incident

Detection relies on identifying indicators of a security incident through various channels, including:

- Matching events in log files, error messages, IDS alerts, firewall alerts, and other data sources to known threat behavior patterns.
- Recognizing deviations from baseline system metrics.
- Proactively searching for signs of intrusion through threat hunting.
- Notifying based on reports from employees, customers, or suppliers.
- Monitoring publicly reported vulnerabilities or threats by vendors, regulators, the media, or other external parties.

Confidential reporting options should be available to encourage the reporting of insider threats without fear.

## First Responder

When a suspicious event is detected, the first responder within the Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) must be promptly notified. The first responder takes charge of the situation and initiates the appropriate response. All employees in the organization should be trained to recognize and report security incidents.
