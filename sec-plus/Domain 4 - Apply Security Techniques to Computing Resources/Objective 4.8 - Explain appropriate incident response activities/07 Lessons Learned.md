# Lessons Learned

## Lessons Learned Process

- Reviews severe security incidents to determine root causes.
- Evaluates if incidents were avoidable and how to prevent future occurrences.

## Steps in Lessons Learned

1. Initial Meeting:
   - Staff involved in the incident, including non-involved incident handlers, meet to review the incident and responses.
   - Focus on improvement, not blame.

2. Disciplinary Concerns:
   - Leadership handles disciplinary concerns separately if staff failed to follow procedures.

3. Lessons Learned Report (LLR) or After-Action Report (AAR):
   - Analysts compile a report summarizing the incident and the discussion during the meeting.

4. Root Cause Analysis:
   - Determine how the incident occurred using models like the "Five Whys" or other approaches.
   - Identify root causes of the incident.

## Root Cause Analysis

- "Five Whys" model:
   - Ask successive "Why" questions to drill down to root causes.
   - Example: Why was the data loss prevention system disabled? Because they were trusted with privileges to do so.

- Alternative Questions:
   - Who, why, when, where, how, and what:
     - Identify the adversary, motives, timing, affected systems, tactics, and security controls.

- Incident Timeline Review:
   - Step through the incident timeline to understand decisions, reasoning, and better mitigation options.
