## Cybersecurity Infrastructure

Cybersecurity infrastructure consists of hardware and software tools that facilitate incident detection, digital forensics, and case management:

- Incident detection tools automate the collection and analysis of network traffic, system monitoring, and log data.
- Digital forensics tools aid in acquiring and validating data from system memory and file systems for incident response or prosecution.
- Case management tools provide databases for logging incident details and coordinating response activities.

These functions are often integrated into a single product suite, including SIEM and SOAR tools, which offer alerting and monitoring dashboards for comprehensive incident response management.

## Cyber Incident Response Team

Incident response requires a skilled team with diverse security competencies. The team may be referred to as a CIRT, CSIRT, CERT, or be part of a SOC. Key roles include:

- **Senior Executive Decision-Maker:** Authorizes actions for serious incidents.
- **Managers:** Coordinate day-to-day CIRT operations and liaise with other business departments.
- **Analysts and Technicians:** Prioritize cases and mitigate minor incidents.

Expertise from other business divisions, such as Legal, HR, and Public Relations, may also be called upon for their input.

## Communication Plan

Incident response policies should establish clear communication lines for reporting incidents and notifying affected parties. Essential contact information should be readily available.

Ensure that communication does not inadvertently leak information to threat actors. Use out-of-band communication methods to prevent interception.

## Stakeholder Management

Avoid publicizing incidents prematurely in the press or social media. Parties with privileged information should not release it to untrusted parties.

Consider obligations to report incidents to regulators or law enforcement. Address the marketing and PR impact of incidents to maintain customer trust.

## Incident Response Plan (IRP)

The preparation phase results in a formal IRP. This document outlines procedures, contacts, and available resources for responding to various incident categories.
