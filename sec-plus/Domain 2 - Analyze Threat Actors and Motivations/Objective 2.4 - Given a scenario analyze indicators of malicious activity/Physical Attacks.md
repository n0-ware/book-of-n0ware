# PHYSICAL ATTACKS

## Brute Force Physical Attacks
- **Examples**:
  - Smashing hardware devices for denial of service (DoS).
  - Forcible entry into premises or cabinets, indicating theft or tampering.
- **Tamper-Evident Systems**: Designed to show visible signs of forced entry, aiding in identifying theft or unauthorized access.

## Environmental Attacks
- **Nature**: Attempts to disrupt services by targeting the environment.
- **Examples**:
  - Destroying power lines.
  - Cutting network cables.
  - Disrupting cooling systems.
- **Objective**: Often to perform denial of service or gain network access via building maintenance systems.

## RFID Cloning
- **Context**: Used in contactless building access control systems.
- **Types of Attacks**:
  - **Card Cloning**: Duplicating an existing access card, especially those without cryptographic protections.
  - **Skimming**: Using counterfeit readers to capture and duplicate card or badge details.
- **Target**: Generally effective against "dumb" access cards with static tokens.
- **Indicators of Compromise**: Suspicious card use locations or patterns, such as impossible travel scenarios.

## Near-Field Communication (NFC)
- **Relation to RFID**: Derived from RFID, used for contactless cards.
- **Functionality**: Operates at close range, enabling two-way communication between devices.

Physical attacks represent a significant threat to organizational security, requiring robust physical security measures and monitoring to detect and mitigate these types of threats effectively.
