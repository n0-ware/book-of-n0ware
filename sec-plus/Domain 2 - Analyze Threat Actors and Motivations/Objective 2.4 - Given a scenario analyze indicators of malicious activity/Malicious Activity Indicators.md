- **Analysis**: Involves detailed examination of process, file system, and network behavior.

## Sandbox Execution
- **Purpose**: Isolates suspect code or host for analysis in a secure environment.
- **Function**: Records file system, registry changes, and network activity.

## Resource Consumption
- **Monitoring**: Using performance monitors to detect excessive CPU usage, memory leaks, abnormal disk activity.
- **Caution**: These symptoms can also arise from non-malicious causes.

## File System
- **Analysis**: Examines metadata, temporary files, and access patterns to establish incident timelines.

## Resource Inaccessibility
- **Indication**: Often a sign of a denial of service (DoS) attack.

## Account Compromise
