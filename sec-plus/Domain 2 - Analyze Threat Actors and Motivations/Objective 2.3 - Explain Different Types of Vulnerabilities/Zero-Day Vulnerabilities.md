# Zero-Day Vulnerabilities
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`
> *Last Modified:* `=this.file.mday`

## Definition
- **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities**: Previously unknown flaws in software or hardware that can be exploited before the vendor is aware or able to patch them.
- **Term Origin**: Indicates that developers have "zero days" to fix the issue once it becomes known.

## Impact
- **Consequences**: Allow attackers to compromise systems, steal data, launch further attacks, or cause harm undetected.
- **Targets**: Often used against high-value targets like governmental institutions and major corporations.
- **Security Challenge**: Traditional security measures are ineffective due to the lack of known signatures or patterns.

## Exploitation
- **Attackers**: Favored by advanced threat actors, including organized crime groups and nation-state attackers.
- **Stealth and Danger**: Zero-day attacks are unpredictable and can cause widespread damage before detection and patching.

## Discovery and Response
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Ethical security researchers inform vendors privately to develop a patch before public disclosure.
- **Race to Patch**: A discovery triggers a race between exploiters and developers to exploit or patch the vulnerability.
- **Financial Value**: Zero-day exploits, especially for mobile OS, can have significant monetary value.

## Usage
- **Strategic Use**: Reserved for high-value attacks due to their financial value and potential impact.
- **Stockpiling**: State security and law enforcement agencies may stockpile zero-days for crime investigation purposes.
