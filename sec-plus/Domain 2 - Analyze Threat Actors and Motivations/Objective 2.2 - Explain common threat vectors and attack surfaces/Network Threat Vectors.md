# Network Threat Vectors

## Exploiting Vulnerable Software
- **Remote Exploits**: Executed over a network without needing authenticated sessions.
- **Local Exploits**: Require execution from an authenticated session on the system.
## Minimizing Risks from Software Vulnerabilities
- **Objective**: Reduce attack surface by eliminating unsecure networks.
- **Unsecure Network Characteristics**:
  - **Lack of Confidentiality**: Risk of eavesdropping attacks.
  - **Lack of Integrity**: Vulnerability to on-path attacks.
  - **Lack of Availability**: Susceptibility to denial of service (DoS) attacks.
- **Secure Network Features**: Utilizes access control and cryptographic solutions for security.
## Specific Threat Vectors in Unsecure Networks
- **Direct Access**: Physical access to perpetrate attacks (e.g., accessing unlocked workstations, stealing devices).
- **Wired Network**: Unauthorized devices on physical network ports leading to various network attacks.
- **Remote and Wireless Network**: Credential theft, spoofing, and credential harvesting.
- **Cloud Access**: Targeting weak credentials in cloud services or attacking cloud service providers.
- **Bluetooth Network**: Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations over Bluetooth.
- **Default Credentials**: Control of network devices/apps with default passwords.
- **Open Service Port**: Unauthenticated access to network ports vulnerable to exploits or disruption.
## Serve and Network Configuration
- **Necessity vs. Security**: Balance between opening necessary ports and minimizing unnecessary ones.
- **Reducing Attack Surface**: Implementing secure design principles, access controls, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.
