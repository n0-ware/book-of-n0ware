# Attack Surface and Threat Vectors
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`

## Attack Surface
- **Definition**: All points where a malicious actor could exploit a vulnerability.
- **Components**: Includes network ports, apps, computers, and user interactions.
- **Minimization Strategy**:
  - Restricting access to known endpoints, protocols/ports, and services/methods.
  - Assessing for vulnerabilities and monitoring for intrusions.

## Examples of Attack Surface Vulnerabilities
1. Public-facing servers hacked on a local network.
2. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on public-facing servers connected to a local network.
3. Hacking of public-facing name servers.
4. Messaging systems allowing transmission of malicious attachments to private computers.
5. Internal servers compromised via malicious devices brought on-site.
6. Backdoors opened via employee shadow IT devices.
7. Misuse of permissions by malicious insiders.

## Assessing the Attack Surface
- **Scope**: Can range from overall organizational level to specific servers, web applications, or employee accounts.
- **Considerations**:
  - Tailoring the assessment to the attributes of the most threatening actors.
  - External actor attack surface should be smaller than for insider threats.

## Threat Vectors
- **Definition**: Paths used by threat actors to execute attacks like data exfiltration, service disruption, or disinformation.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Sophisticated actors use multiple vectors.
  - Likely to plan multistage campaigns rather than single attacks.
  - Capable actors might develop novel vectors.
- **Understanding**: Knowledge of an organization's attack surface is crucial for defense against these vectors.

## Terminology Clarification
- **Threat Vector vs. Attack Vector**:
  - Often used interchangeably.
  - "Threat vector" sometimes refers to potential attack surface analysis.
  - "Attack vector" can refer to analyzing an exploit that has been successfully executed.
