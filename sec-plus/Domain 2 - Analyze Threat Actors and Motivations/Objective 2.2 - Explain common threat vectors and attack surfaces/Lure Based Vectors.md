## Concept of Lure in Cybersecurity
- **Definition**: An attractive bait that delivers a malicious payload, often to gain control over a system or disrupt services.
- **Purpose**: Used when direct access for remote or local exploits is not feasible.
## Common Media Used as Lures
- **Removable Device**: Malware concealed on USB drives or memory cards. 
  - **Drop Attack**: Infected USB sticks left in accessible areas to entice employees to connect them to computers.
- **Executable File**: Malware hidden within program files, like Trojan Horse malware.
  - **Trojan**: Appears useful or fun but creates backdoor access for the threat actor.
- **Document Files**: Malicious code embedded in word processing or PDF files.
  - **Method**: Utilizes scripting features or exploits vulnerabilities in viewer/editor software.
- **Image Files**: Exploit code within image files targeting vulnerabilities in browsers or document editing software.
## Attack Surface and Management
- **Scope**: Extends from USB and flash card readers to software for web browsing and document viewing/editing.
- **Management Strategies**: 
  - Effective endpoint security management.
  - Implementation of vulnerability management.
  - Use of antivirus programs.
  - Program execution control.
  - Intrusion detection systems.
