Categories and types of controls cover myriad functions, making selective of the right and effective controls challenging. 

Frameworks provide a benchmark and guide for organizations to follow and measure against, ensuring no security program is designed or implemented in isolation. These foundations build up from a baseline to very mature organizational standards. They also allow for reliable measurements of an organizations security capabilities, and where they fall short and may need to invest effort or capital.
