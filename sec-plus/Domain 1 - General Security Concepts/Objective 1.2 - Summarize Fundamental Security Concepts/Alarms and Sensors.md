## Alarm Systems
- **Role**: Alarms are critical in physical security, serving as both detective and deterrent controls.
- **Integration**: Often integrated with other security systems like access control and surveillance.
- **Types of Alarms**:
  - **Circuit**: Alarms triggered by the opening or closing of a circuit, typically used in doors, windows, or fences.
  - **Motion Detection**: Triggered by movement, using microwave radio reflection or passive infrared sensors.
  - **Noise Detection**: Activated by specific sounds, utilizing modern AI for accuracy.
  - **Proximity**: Employs RFID tags to track movement of objects and trigger alarms.
  - **Duress**: Manually triggered by staff in threat situations, using various devices like wireless pendants or smartphones.
- **Applications**:
  - Circuit-based alarms for perimeters, windows, and doors.
  - Motion detectors for less frequently used spaces.
  - Duress alarms for staff in public areas.
- **Alarm Features**: Can be audible or silent, linked to monitoring systems or law enforcement.

## Sensor Types
- **Purpose**: Sensors provide proactive detection and alerting in security systems.
- **Technologies**:
  - **Infrared Sensors**: Detect heat pattern changes, used in motion detection systems.
  - **Pressure Sensors**: Activated by weight, suitable for high-security areas or counting foot traffic.
  - **Microwave Sensors**: Emit and measure microwave pulses, often paired with infrared for reduced false alarms.
  - **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Use sound waves to detect presence, commonly in automated lighting systems.
