## Managerial Controls
Defined as a category of security control that gives oversight of the information system.
- Risk identification tools
- Tools for identifying the evaluation or selection of other controls
- Oversight of the security system
- ***Strategic*** insights and reporting
- Policies (not processes/procedures/guidelines)
## Operational Controls
Defined as controls implemented primarily by people (human element). 
- Security guards
- Training programs
- Processes and procedures (SOPs)
- Daily administration and review of tooling
- ***Tactical*** insights and reporting
## Technical Controls
Defined as controls implemented as a system and run on hardware, software or firmware and operate with little intervention once implemented
- Firewalls
- AV or EDR
- DLP
- IDS/IPS
- Access control models on an OS
## Physical Controls
Defined as physical items such as alarms, gateways, locks, lights, or cameras that both deter and detect access to places and hardware. **These are separated from other controls because they deter or prevent physical access from an actual human**
