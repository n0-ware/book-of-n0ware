**Change management** is the systematic approach to managing all changes in an IT infrastructure, with the main goal being to minimize risk and disruption while maximizing value and efficiency. This requires effective planning, considering impacts and dependencies, and requiring contingency and rollback plans in case of problems. The right documentation and communication is also essential to inform stakeholders. 

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Systematically manages changes to products or systems.
- **Goal**: Minimizes risks and prevents negative impacts on security, service availability, and performance.

## Types of Changes Managed
- Software deployments.
- System updates and software patching.
- Hardware replacements/upgrades.
- Network modifications.
- Changes in system configurations.
- New product implementations and software integrations.
- Changes and refreshes to support environments.

## Risks of Poor Management
- Introduction of new vulnerabilities.
- Service disruptions.
- Negative impact on compliance status.

## Change Management Program Elements
- **Tracking**: Monitoring all changes.
- **Assessment**: Evaluating the impact and necessity.
- **Approval**: Gaining authorization from relevant personnel.
- **Review and Audit**: Post-implementation analysis for correctness and outcomes.
- **Documentation**: Includes details, reasons, impacts, and rollback plans for each change.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential security impacts.
- **Operational Resilience**: Contributes to reducing unexpected downtime and vulnerabilities.

## Approval Process
- **Request for Change (RFC)**: Submission outlining change details.
- **Review and Assessment**: By change manager or committee for feasibility and risk.
- **Formal Approval**: Involving relevant stakeholders.
- **Documentation and Communication**: Crucial throughout the process.

- **Expertise**: Involvement of IT professionals, business leaders, compliance officers.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involves diverse groups for comprehensive review and acceptance.
- **Ownership**: Accountability for implementation, risk management, and communication.
- **Stakeholder Participation**: Ensures acceptance and smooth implementation.

## Change Management Concepts
- **Impact Analysis**: Assessing implications of changes on users, processes, or systems.
- **Test Results**: Evaluation in a test environment to predict success and identify issues.
- **Backout Plans**: Contingency plans for reverting changes if necessary.
- **Maintenance Windows**: Predefined times for changes to minimize disruption.
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Detailed instructions for consistent and effective change implementation.
