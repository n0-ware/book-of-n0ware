Governance committees play a critical role in ensuring organizations comply with cybersecurity laws and regulations to mitigate legal liability. The strategic plan of an organization must address these external factors in cybersecurity governance.

## Legal Risks Management

Governance committees are tasked with managing various legal risks, including regulatory compliance, contractual obligations, public disclosure laws, breach liability, privacy laws, intellectual property protection, and licensing agreements. They must interpret and translate these legal requirements into operational controls to ensure legal compliance, ethical conduct, and organizational protection.

## Key Frameworks and Regulations

Key frameworks, benchmarks, and configuration guides are used to demonstrate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Due diligence is essential to ensure responsible individuals do not neglect their duties, as negligence can lead to criminal and civil liabilities. For example, in the United States, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) mandates risk assessments, internal controls, and audit procedures. The Computer Security Act (1987) and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) govern data security in federal agencies.

## Industry-Specific Regulations

Many regulations have specific cybersecurity control requirements, while others mandate best practices based on industry or international frameworks. Organizations may need to map between different industry frameworks, such as NIST and ISO 27K, to meet regulatory requirements. Auditors often expect organizations to implement these frameworks to demonstrate a strong and competent security program.

## Global Law

As information systems become more interconnected globally, laws with international reach have emerged. Examples include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which protect privacy irrespective of geopolitical boundaries.

### GDPR

The GDPR focuses on protecting privacy and personal data. It requires informed consent for data collection and processing, clear descriptions in plain language, and grants data subjects rights to withdraw consent and manage their data. Non-compliance can result in substantial fines.

### CCPA

The CCPA provides California residents with rights to access, delete, or opt out of the sale of their personal information. It applies to organizations providing goods or services to California residents, regardless of location or revenue.

## Regulations and National, Local, Regional, and Industry Laws

Many countries have national-level laws to support effective cybersecurity practices and protect citizen data. These laws vary in scope and detail but impact organizations operating in different jurisdictions.

### Examples:

- HIPAA (United States): Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
- GLBA (United States): Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.
- Data Protection Act 2018 (United Kingdom).
- NIS Regulations 2018 (United Kingdom).
- PIPEDA (Canada): Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.
- Information Technology Act 2000 (India).
- Privacy Act 1988 (Australia).

Local and regional laws, such as the New York DFS Part 500 Cybersecurity Regulation and Massachusetts 201 CMR 17.00, may also apply.

## Industry-Specific Regulations

Various industries have specific cybersecurity laws and regulations governing data handling and protection. Examples include:

- Healthcare: HIPAA (United States), GDPR (European Union).
- Financial Services: GLBA (United States), PCI DSS (Contractual obligation).
- Telecommunications: CALEA (United States).
- Energy: NERC (United States and Canada).
- Education & Children: FERPA, CIPA, COPPA (United States).
- Government: FISMA (United States), CJIS (United States), GSC (United Kingdom).

These regulations address data security, privacy, and compliance within specific sectors. Organizations must navigate this complex legal framework to ensure cybersecurity operations and governance align with legal requirements.
