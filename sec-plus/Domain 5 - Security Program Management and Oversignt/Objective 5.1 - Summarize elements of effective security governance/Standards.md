# Standards

Standards play a crucial role in defining expected outcomes and benchmarks within an organization. They are essential for ensuring compliance, security, and effective operations. The selection and application of standards are influenced by various factors, including regulatory requirements, business needs, risk management strategies, industry practices, and stakeholder expectations.

## Regulatory Requirements

Regulatory requirements are a primary driver for adopting standards. Organizations must adhere to specific legal and security regulations. For example, the healthcare industry in the United States follows data protection and privacy standards established by HIPAA.

## Business-Specific Needs

Organizations adopt standards that address their specific needs based on their operations, customer base, and technological dependencies. For instance, PCI DSS is adopted by organizations handling credit card transactions to safeguard cardholder data.

## Risk Management Strategies

Standards assist in identifying, evaluating, and managing risks. ISO/IEC 27001 provides a framework for managing security risks effectively. Adhering to industry best practices influences the adoption of standards.

## Stakeholder Expectations

Stakeholders, including customers, partners, vendors, investors, and executive boards, influence the choice of standards. Adherence to recognized standards demonstrates an organization's commitment to quality, security, and reliability.

The selection of standards is a strategic decision that balances legal requirements, business needs, risk management, industry best practices, and stakeholder expectations. Adopting the right standards enhances operational effectiveness, while the wrong standards or improper implementation can have negative consequences.

## Common Industry Standards

1. **ISO/IEC 27001**: International standard for information security management systems (ISMS) ensuring security controls are in place.
    
2. **ISO/IEC 27002**: Companion standard to ISO 27001, providing detailed guidance on specific controls.
    
3. **ISO/IEC 27017**: Specific to cloud services, extending ISO 27001.
    
4. **ISO/IEC 27018**: Focuses on protecting personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds.
    
5. **NIST Special Publication 800-63**: US government standard for digital identity guidelines, including password and access control requirements.
    
6. **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**: Ensures security when handling credit card data.
    
7. **FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards)**: NIST standards for federal computer systems, specifying requirements for cryptography.
    

These industry standards play a significant role in auditing and evaluating organizational compliance and security practices. They provide comprehensive guidance for information security, risk management, data protection, and privacy.

## Internal Standards

Organizations establish internal standards to ensure safety, integrity, and consistency in operations, protecting valuable resources like data, intellectual property, and hardware. Internal standards define implementation details for important practices.

### Password Standards

- Define technical requirements for password management, hashing algorithms, password salting, secure password transmission, password reset, and password managers.

### Access Control Standards

- Define access models (e.g., RBAC, DAC, MAC), user identity verification methods, privilege management, authentication protocols, session management, and audit trails.

### Physical Security Standards

- Address building security, workstation security, datacenter and server room security, equipment disposal, and visitor management.

### Encryption Standards

- Define encryption algorithms, key lengths, key management procedures, and encryption for data at rest and in transit.

Internal standards ensure consistency and compliance with best practices, enhancing security and operational efficiency. They focus on implementation details and complement organizational policies.
