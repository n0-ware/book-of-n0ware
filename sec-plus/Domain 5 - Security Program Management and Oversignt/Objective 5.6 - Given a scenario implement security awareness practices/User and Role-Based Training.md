> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`
> *Last Modified:* `=this.file.mday`

### 1. Audience and Topics

- **Audience:** Training should be delivered to employees at all levels, including end users, technical staff, and executives.
- **Topics:** General topics to cover include:
    - Organization's security policies and penalties for noncompliance.
    - Incident identification and reporting procedures.
    - Site security procedures and restrictions.
    - Data handling practices, including confidentiality and encryption.
    - Password and account management.
    - Awareness of social engineering and malware threats.
    - Secure use of software and Internet access.

### 2. Training Program Design

- **Role-based Training:** Identify staff performing security-sensitive roles and tailor training based on their specific responsibilities.
- **Grading Levels:** Determine the level of training required for each role, such as beginner, intermediate, and advanced.
- **Focus on Job Roles:** Design training programs based on job roles rather than titles, as employees may perform different roles with varying security requirements.

### 3. Frameworks and Guidelines

- **NIST NICE Framework:** Utilize the NIST National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education framework to define knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) for different cybersecurity roles.
- **SP800-50:** Refer to NIST Special Publication 800-50 for guidance on security awareness programs.

By implementing user and role-based training programs based on these principles, organizations can enhance cybersecurity awareness, reduce vulnerabilities stemming from human error, and foster a culture of security within the workforce.
