# Risk Management Process
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`

Risk management is a process for identifying, assessing, and mitigating vulnerabilities and threats to essential business functions. It involves five phases:

1. **Identify Mission Essential Functions**: Focus on critical functions that can cause business failure if not performed. Identify supporting systems and assets.

2. **Identify Vulnerabilities**: Analyze systems and assets for vulnerabilities or weaknesses, starting with critical functions.

3. **Identify Threats**: Determine threat sources and actors that may exploit vulnerabilities or trigger them accidentally.

4. **Analyze Business Impacts**: Assess risk based on likelihood and impact of vulnerabilities being activated as security incidents.

5. **Identify Risk Response**: Determine countermeasures and assess the cost of additional security controls.

## Likelihood and Impact

- **Likelihood**: Describes the chance of a risk event happening (low, medium, high).
- **Probability**: Quantitative measure expressed as a numerical value or percentage.
- **Impact**: Severity of the risk if realized as a security incident, influenced by asset value and disruption cost.

## Risk Management Frameworks

- **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)**: Policies and procedures based on frameworks like NIST's RMF or ISO 31K.
- **Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA)**: Internal process to identify and assess risks.
- **Risk and Control Assessment (RCA)**: External party-led risk assessment.

## Risk Registers

- A document showing results of risk assessments, including severity, owner, and mitigation strategies.
- Can include a heat map risk matrix, scatterplot graphs, and shared among stakeholders.

## Risk Threshold

- Defines acceptable risk levels an organization is willing to tolerate.
- Based on regulatory requirements, organizational objectives, stakeholder expectations, and risk appetite.

## Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

- Critical predictive indicators to monitor and predict potential risks.
- Assess likelihood and potential impact of risks, aiding risk register and management practices.

## Risk Owner

- Responsible for managing a specific risk.
- Identifies, assesses, mitigates, monitors, and communicates the risk.
- Often assigned to leadership team members.

## Risk Appetite and Tolerance

- **Risk Appetite**: Organization's willingness to accept risk.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Specific amount of variance accepted regarding measured risk levels.
- Risks exceeding tolerance are prioritized and managed urgently.

## Levels of Risk Appetite

- **Expansionary**: Willing to take higher risks for high returns or aggressive growth.
- **Conservative**: Prioritizes risk avoidance, cautious approach.
- **Neutral**: Balances expansionary and conservative approaches, takes risks aligned with objectives.

## Risk Reporting

- Methods to communicate an organization's risk profile and effectiveness of risk management.
- Tailored to the intended audience (e.g., board members, managers, technical employees).
- Includes recommended risk responses.
