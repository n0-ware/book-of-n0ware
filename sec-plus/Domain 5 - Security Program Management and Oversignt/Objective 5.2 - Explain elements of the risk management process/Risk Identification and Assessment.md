## Risk Identification

- **Fundamental Process**: Risk identification is crucial for managing cybersecurity risks, including malware attacks, phishing attempts, insider threats, equipment failures, software vulnerabilities, and non-technical risks.
- **Methods**: It involves methods like vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, security audits, threat intelligence, and more.
- **Foundation for Risk Management**: Effective risk identification forms the foundation for risk assessment and management, enabling informed resource allocation and risk mitigation.

## Risk Assessment

- **Core Component**: Risk assessment evaluates identified risks to determine their potential impact on the organization.
- **Methodologies**: It includes ad hoc, recurring, one-time, and continuous assessments based on needs, timing, and tools.
- **Data Interpretation**: Risk assessment considers the likelihood and severity of events, prioritizes risks, and defines risk management strategies.

## Risk Analysis vs. Risk Assessment

- **Risk Analysis**: Focuses on identifying and understanding risks' causes, consequences, and characteristics.
- **Risk Assessment**: Systematically estimates potential risk levels and significance based on data collected during risk analysis.

## Quantitative Analysis

- **Assigning Concrete Values**: Quantitative risk analysis aims to assign numerical values to risks.
- **Metrics**: It includes Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) and Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) to calculate potential financial impact.
- **Asset Value**: Considers material asset value, direct costs, and consequences on intangible assets like reputation.
- **Justifying Controls**: Quantitative analysis helps justify security control expenses by associating cost savings with controls.

## Qualitative Analysis

- **Subjective Approach**: Qualitative risk analysis assesses risks based on subjective judgment and qualitative factors.
- **Understanding Impact**: It provides a qualitative understanding of risks, their impact, likelihood, and interdependencies.
- **Simplicity**: It's simple to use, doesn't require complex calculations, and enables quick initial risk assessment.

## Inherent Risk

- **Measure Before Mitigation**: Inherent risk is the level of risk before any mitigation efforts.
- **Balancing Costs**: Security controls can be expensive, so organizations aim to balance control costs with risk costs.
- **Risk Posture**: The overall status of risk management is referred to as risk posture.

## Heat Map

- **Visual Representation**: A heat map or "traffic light" impact matrix visually represents risk severity, likelihood, control costs, and more.
- **Concentration of Efforts**: It helps identify areas where security efforts should be concentrated to improve security.

## Potential Impacts

- **Classification**: Risks are classified based on the impact of confidentiality, integrity, or availability breaches.
- **Categories**: Potential impacts are categorized as low, moderate, or high, depending on the severity and consequences.
