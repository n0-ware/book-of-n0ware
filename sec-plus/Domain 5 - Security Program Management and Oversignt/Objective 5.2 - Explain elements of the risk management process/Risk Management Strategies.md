# Risk Management Strategies
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`

Risk management strategies are proactive and systematic approaches to identify, assess, prioritize, and mitigate risks to minimize their negative impacts.

## Risk Mitigation

- **Risk Reduction**: The process of reducing exposure to or the effects of risk factors.
- **Risk Deterrence**: Countermeasures that reduce exposure to a threat or vulnerability.
- **Examples**: Policies to control flammable materials (reducing likelihood) and fire alarms/sprinklers (reducing impact).
- **Off-site Data Backup**: A remediation option in case of data loss due to incidents like fire.

## Risk Avoidance

- **Stopping Risk-Generating Activity**: Avoidance means ceasing the activity that causes the risk.
- **Example**: Abandoning the development and sale of a software application with security vulnerabilities.
- **Infrequent Option**: Avoidance is rarely a credible option in practice.

## Risk Transference

- **Assigning Risk to a Third Party**: Transference involves shifting risk to a third party, like an insurance company.
- **Cybersecurity Insurance**: Specific insurance to protect against fines and liabilities arising from data breaches and attacks.
- **Limitations**: Reputation risks may remain, and legal liabilities are unlikely to be entirely transferred.

## Risk Acceptance

- **No Countermeasures**: Risk acceptance means no countermeasures are implemented because the risk level is deemed acceptable.
- **Allowable Risk**: Organizations determine what level of risk is allowable based on various factors.
- **Risk Exception**: Formal recognition of a risk that cannot be mitigated within specified constraints, requiring approval and periodic review.
- **Risk Exemption**: Accepting a risk without mitigation due to strategic benefits or cost considerations, also requiring formal approval and review.

## Residual Risk and Risk Appetite

- **Residual Risk**: The likelihood and impact of risk after mitigation, transference, or acceptance measures.
- **Risk Appetite**: A strategic assessment of what level of residual risk is tolerable.
- **Scope**: Risk appetite is institution-wide and influenced by regulatory and compliance constraints.
