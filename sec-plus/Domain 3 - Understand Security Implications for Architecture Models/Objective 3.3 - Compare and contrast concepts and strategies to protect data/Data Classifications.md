# Data Classifications

Data classification schemas help manage data through its lifecycle by tagging assets based on confidentiality, type, or other criteria.

## Based on Confidentiality
- **Public (Unclassified)**: No restrictions on access. Disclosure poses no risk, but modification or unavailability does.
- **Confidential (Secret)**: Highly sensitive, accessible only to approved individuals within the organization or under NDA.
- **Critical (Top Secret)**: Extremely valuable, with viewing severely restricted to prevent any risk of capture.

## Example: Microsoft Azure Information Protection

## Based on Information Asset Type
- **Proprietary/IP**: Information about products/services owned by the company. Targeted by competitors or of interest to foreign governments.
- **Private/Personal Data**: Relates to individual identity, including PII such as names, addresses, SSN, financial info, health records, and biometric data.
- **Sensitive**: Information that could harm or prejudice an individual if disclosed. Includes religious beliefs, political opinions, union membership, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, genetic data, and health information as per GDPR.
- **Restricted**: Highly confidential information requiring stringent controls and limited access, where unauthorized disclosure could cause significant harm.

Data classification plays a crucial role in data security, compliance, and management, ensuring appropriate measures are taken to protect and handle data according to its classification.
