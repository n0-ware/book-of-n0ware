## Air-Gapped Hosts and Networks
- **Definition**: Hosts or networks that are not physically connected to any other network.
- **Examples**:
  - Root certification authority in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
  - Hosts for malware analysis.

## Application of Air-Gapped Networks
- **Usage**: Common in military bases, government sites, and industrial facilities.
- **Configuration**: Allows internal communication but prevents external network connections.

## Security and Management Implications
- **Security Benefits**:
  - Provides robust protection against network-based attacks.
  - Ensures critical systems are isolated from potential cyber threats.
- **Management Challenges**:
  - Requires local terminal administration.
  - Updates and installations via USB or optical media.
  - Media used must be thoroughly scanned to prevent introducing threats.

Physical isolation through air-gapped systems represents a high level of security for critical assets but demands meticulous and secure management practices.
