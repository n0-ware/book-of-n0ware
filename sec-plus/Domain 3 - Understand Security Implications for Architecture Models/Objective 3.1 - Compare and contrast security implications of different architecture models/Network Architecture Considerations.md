# Network Architecture Considerations
> *Creation Date:* `=this.file.cday`

When evaluating network architecture and selecting controls, several factors are crucial:

## Cost
- **Capital Outlay**: Initial investment in changes, appliances, and software.
- **Depreciation**: Loss of value over time.
- **Ongoing Liabilities**: Maintenance and support costs.
- **Value Calculation**: Based on reduction in incident-related losses.

## Compute and Responsiveness
- **Goal**: Minimize processing time for workloads.
- **Resources**: Adequate CPU, memory, storage, and bandwidth for response times.
- **Cost Implication**: Higher compute resources lead to increased costs.

## Scalability and Ease of Deployment
- **Adaptability**: Ability to adjust to workload fluctuations.
- **Recovery of Costs**: Challenges in recovering costs if workloads decrease.
- **Deployment Challenges**: Difficulties in deploying/upgrading nodes if workloads increase.

## Availability
- **Objective**: Minimize downtime and maximize uptime.
- **Impact of Downtime**: Affects reputation, revenue, and profitability.
- **Causes**: Includes both planned maintenance and unplanned failures/incidents.

## Resilience and Ease of Recovery
- **Recovery Time**: Reducing time taken to recover from failures.
- **Automation**: Systems that recover without manual intervention are more resilient.

## Power
- **Facility Demand**: Meeting the energy demands of devices and workloads.
- **Cost Impact**: Higher power usage increases costs.
- **Infrastructure**: Importance of minimizing power failures for availability.

## Patch Availability
- **Protection**: Against exploits for known vulnerabilities.
- **Vendor Support**: Challenges when relying on third-party maintenance or end-of-life products.

## Risk Transference
- **Outsourcing**: Contracting a third party to manage infrastructure.
- **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)**: Defined metrics and penalties for responsiveness, scalability, availability, and resilience.

## On-Premises Networks
- **Characteristics**: High capital costs, low scalability.
- **Challenges**: Upgrading infrastructure, complex recovery procedures.
- **Comparison**: Lower availability and resilience compared to cloud networking solutions.

Choosing the right network architecture involves balancing these considerations to meet the organization's specific needs and constraints.
