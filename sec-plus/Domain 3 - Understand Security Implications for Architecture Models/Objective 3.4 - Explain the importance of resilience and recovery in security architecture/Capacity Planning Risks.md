### People Risks
- **Insufficient staffing or skills gaps**, leading to inadequate resource allocation.
- **Lack of cross-training** or succession planning, creating dependency on specific individuals.
- **Resistance to change**, lack of employee engagement, or ineffective communication hindering operations.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement **cross-training** to reduce dependency on specific individuals.
- Develop **remote work plans** to ensure continuity during disruptions.
- Establish **alternative reporting structures** to maintain operations if key personnel are unavailable.
- Prioritize **effective communication** during disruptive events.

### Technology and Software for Remote Work
- **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** for secure network access.
- **Remote Desktop Software** for accessing office computers.
- **Cloud-Based Tools** like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace for collaboration.
- **Video Conferencing Software** such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams.
- **Instant Messaging and Chat Tools** for real-time communication.
- **Virtual Phone Systems** for making/receiving calls remotely.
- **Project Management Tools** for task and project tracking.

### Changes in Workforce Capacity
- **Layoffs** can introduce cybersecurity and physical risks, including potential for disgruntled employee actions and loss of experienced staff knowledge.
- **Mitigation:** Incorporate potential layoffs into capacity planning, implement robust offboarding procedures, and maintain a strong security culture.

### Other Risks from Poor Capacity Planning
- **Overloaded systems** increase susceptibility to crashes and DoS attacks.
- **Limited resources** may neglect essential security measures.
- **Inadequate infrastructure investment** exposes organizations to unauthorized access or theft.
- **Overestimating capacity needs** leads to increased costs, inefficient resource utilization, and added complexity in managing technology.

**Mitigation:**
- Aim for a **balanced approach** to capacity planning, considering both current and future needs.
- Regularly **review and update** capacity plans to optimize resource allocation.
