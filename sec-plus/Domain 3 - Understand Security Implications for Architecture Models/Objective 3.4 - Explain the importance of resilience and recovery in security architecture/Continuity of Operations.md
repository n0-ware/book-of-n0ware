## Continuity of Operations (COOP)

COOP focuses on ensuring an organization can maintain or quickly resume critical functions during disruptions. Key elements include:
- Identifying critical functions and resources
- Creating redundancy for IT systems and data
- Establishing alternative work arrangements
- Developing clear communication protocols
- Regularly testing and updating COOP plans

## Relationship to Business Continuity

COOP is a subset of business continuity (BC), focusing on the immediate restoration of critical functions. BC encompasses a broader approach to resilience and recovery, including supply chain management and reputation management.

## Backups in COOP

Backups are crucial for COOP, protecting against data loss and facilitating system restoration. Regular testing ensures backup integrity and effectiveness.

## Capacity Planning

Capacity planning assesses current and future resource requirements to meet business objectives, covering people, technology, and infrastructure. Methods include trend analysis, simulation modeling, and benchmarking, aimed at optimizing resource allocation and supporting growth or demand changes.
