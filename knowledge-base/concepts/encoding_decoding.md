# Encoding and Decoding

## Description

Firstly, encoding **is not** encryption. Encoding relies on well-known systems of converting data into another type of data, usually for the purpose of sending complex data objects, such as `JSON`, through a medium that requires a specific set of *ASCII* characters, a specific data format, etc. Cookies, for example, are often encoded in `base64` to allow `JSON` notation for user credentials to pass to a browser, for example
