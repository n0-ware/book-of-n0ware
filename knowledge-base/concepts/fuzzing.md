# Fuzzing

## Description
Fuzzing is essentially a means of testing a portion of a web application, usually through automation, until the application produces a vulnerability or valuable piece of information. When fuzzing, you are sending the expected type of information or request to the application, but at an extremely high rate of speed, allowing you to employ very large sets of information, such as wordlists, to test the web applications responses. 

[BurpSuite](../../tools_and_tricks/tools/BurpSuite.md) is commonly used for fuzzing with the *Cluster Bomb* tool.
