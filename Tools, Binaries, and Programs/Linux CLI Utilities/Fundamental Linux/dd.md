# dd

See [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dd-command-linux/) for an excellent demonstration of this command. 

`dd` is a command-line utility with the primary purpose being to copy files, oftentimes large sections of files such as boot drives for backup. 

`dd` differs from `cp` in that it has options to control byte sizes, convert, and more.
