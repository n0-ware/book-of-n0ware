# tcpdump
###### Tags[^1]
The `tcpdump` command-line utility is used for packet capture over the wire, highly customizable for the desired interface and protocols you want it to capture. 

It can run passively in the background, configured to save the packet capture files (PCAP's) in a rotation based on factors such as time, storage size, and more. 

These packets can later be ingested by other programs, such as [Wireshark](../../../../book-of-n0ware/Tools,%20Binaries,%20and%20Programs/Traffic%20Analysis/Wireshark.md).
