# Sysinternals
The `sysinternals` suite of tools helps with administration and adds to the command line environment native to *Windows*. It is not a built-in suite, must be downloaded, and contains a wealth of tools for admins to use in their day-to-day tasks.[^1]

There are a huge number of programs included in `sysinternals`, and covering all of them is beyond the scope of a fundamentals course. One tool, however, is useful for security professionals, and it is named `psinfo`.
